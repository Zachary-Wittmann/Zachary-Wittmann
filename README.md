Hello There! I Am *Zachary Wittmann*, Welcome To My Profile!
===============

I am an aspiring **Data Analyst** from El Paso, Texas. 
<br/>I'm currently enrolled at **The University of Texas at El Paso** in Computer Science.
<br/>**GPA:** [3.76]

I enjoy self-improvement and I take pride in always striving to do better than I did before.
<br/>I love honing my skills and techniques to become better.

## 📼 Personal Projects
### 🌹 [RWBY Remnant Royale](https://github.com/Zachary-Wittmann/RWBY-Remnant-Royale) <sub>Created: April 12<sup>th</sup>, 2024</sub>
* A fanmade game clone of Vampire Survivors in the style of RWBY made in Unity

### 🛡️ [PALADIN SYSTEM](https://github.com/Zachary-Wittmann/Hackathons/tree/main/PALADIN%20SYSTEM) <sub>Created: March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2024</sub>
* Worked alongside peers to create a program to assist with police response time by analyzing prior
<br/>police reports to better plot patrol routes.
* The **P**redictive **A**nalytics-Driven **L**aw **A**nd **D**ispatch **I**ntelligence **N**etwork utilized K-Means Clustering
<br/>to allow the creation of hot-spots that could be used in tandem with Google API to calculate
<br/>mileage, time, and location information.
* This project resulted in my team being awarded 3<sup>rd</sup> place at the Smart-Borderland AI Hackathon.

## 💽 Course Work
I am currently a Senior with only **three** classes remaining before my graduation.
<br/>Some relevant courses with their contents are as follows:

### 👨‍💻 Software Engineering Requirements 1 [CS 4310]

    ~ Methodologies, approaches, and techniques associated with software requirements analysis and definition.
    ~ First semester of a two-semester CAPSTONE project working alongside peers and a client.
    ~ Captured and specified requirements for a real-world application, to be coded in Fall 2024.
    Role: Team Leader
    Grade: [A]

### 👨‍💻⛏️ Data Mining [CS 4362]

    ~ Gained insight into mining massive datasets from big data and developed skills in handling said data.
    ~ Optimized and added quality of life features to code provided from the class as located in UTEP-Programs/Data-Mining.
    ~ Tutored peers and assisted in their passing of this class with the majority of them receiving an A.
    Grade: [A]

### 👨‍💻🤖 Machine Learning [CS 4361]

    ~ Learned skills to handle speech recognition, image classification, and textual analysis.
    ~ Worked alongside two teammates to create a personal project of our interest as located in UTEP-Programs/
      Machine-Learning/Movie-Recommender.
    Grade: [A]

### 💽 Operating System Concepts [CS 4375]

    ~ Learned about process and thread management to allow for concurrency.
    ~ Created several programs to be used within a virtual machine to demonstrate learned skills.
    ~ Demonstrated understanding of different ways to approach concurrency while avoiding deadlock and race conditions.
    Grade: [B]

### 👨‍💻🖥️ Advanced Object-Oriented Programming [CS 3331]

    ~ Initialized framework and functionality (such as .csv file handling, dynamic structures to allow modularity,
      and implementation of design patterns) simulating that of Ticketmaster.
    ~ Incorporated my peers’ code to improve and advance the program with new functionality.
    ~ This incorporation allowed for insight into their approach to programming and implementation ofJUnit testing
      and Javadoc.
    Grade: [A]

### 💾 Computer Architecture [CS 3432]

    ~ Compilation, assembly processes, and machine organization.
    ~ Learned how to handle input/output at an assembly level including memory-mapped I/O.
    ~ Created an MSP-430 project that included interrupts and exception handling.
    Grade: [A]

### 🖥 Data Structures [CS 2302]

    ~ Learned about abstract data types and the representation of data using sets, lists, trees, and graphs.
    ~ Optimized code provided during the class in means of runtime and space.
    Grade: [A]

## 📊 GitHub Stats
I usually code my projects locally, then saving the code to a local drive.
<br/>However, I am better about live updating the code to this GitHub now.
