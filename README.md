## 📼 Personal Projects
### ⚔️ [ARES SYSTEM](https://github.com/Zachary-Wittmann/Personal-Projects/tree/main/ARES%20SYSTEM) <sub>Created: May 17<sup>th</sup>, 2024</sub>
* The **A**ssessment of **R**etrospective **E**ngagement **S**cenarios or ARES System is a work in progress that aims to analyze prior engagements throughout different wars in history and try to find patterns between the outcomes of those engagements and the factors that composed the battle.

### ✈️ [MAVERICK](https://github.com/Zachary-Wittmann/MAVERICK) <sub>Created: April 13<sup>th</sup>, 2024</sub>
* Worked along team members of ***Atlas Development*** during the **Borderland Glitch Game Jam** to create a game in under 48 hours.
* **MAVERICK** is a Top Gun themed game inspired by the style of 1942/Galaga created within **Unity** and utilizing **GIMP** for asset creation.
* Further documentation for the game can be found by clicking the title.

### 🌹 RWBY Remnant Royale <sub>Created: April 12<sup>th</sup>, 2024</sub>
* A fanmade game clone of Vampire Survivors in the style of RWBY made in Unity

### 🛡️ [PALADIN SYSTEM](https://github.com/Zachary-Wittmann/Hackathons/tree/main/PALADIN%20SYSTEM) <sub>Created: March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2024</sub>
* Worked alongside peers to create a program to assist with police response time by analyzing prior
  police reports to better plot patrol routes.
* The **P**redictive **A**nalytics-Driven **L**aw **A**nd **D**ispatch **I**ntelligence **N**etwork utilized K-Means Clustering to allow the creation of hot-spots that could be used in tandem with Google API to calculate mileage, time, and location information.
* This project resulted in my team being awarded 3<sup>rd</sup> place at the Smart-Borderland AI Hackathon.

    ~ Methodologies, approaches, and techniques associated with software requirements analysis and definition.
    ~ First semester of a two-semester CAPSTONE project working alongside peers and a client.
    ~ Captured and specified requirements for a real-world application, to be coded in Fall 2024.
    Role: Team Leader
    Grade: [A]

### 👨‍💻⛏️ Data Mining [CS 4362]

    ~ Gained insight into mining massive datasets from big data and developed skills in handling said data.
    ~ Optimized and added quality of life features to code provided from the class as located in UTEP-Programs/Data-Mining.
    ~ Tutored peers and assisted in their passing of this class with the majority of them receiving an A.
    Grade: [A]

### 👨‍💻🤖 Machine Learning [CS 4361]

    ~ Learned skills to handle speech recognition, image classification, and textual analysis.
    ~ Worked alongside two teammates to create a personal project of our interest as located in UTEP-Programs/
      Machine-Learning/Movie-Recommender.
    Grade: [A]

### 💽 Operating System Concepts [CS 4375]

    ~ Learned about process and thread management to allow for concurrency.
    ~ Created several programs to be used within a virtual machine to demonstrate learned skills.
    ~ Demonstrated understanding of different ways to approach concurrency while avoiding deadlock and race conditions.
    Grade: [B]

### 👨‍💻🖥️ Advanced Object-Oriented Programming [CS 3331]

    ~ Initialized framework and functionality (such as .csv file handling, dynamic structures to allow modularity,
      and implementation of design patterns) simulating that of Ticketmaster.
    ~ Incorporated my peers’ code to improve and advance the program with new functionality.
    ~ This incorporation allowed for insight into their approach to programming and implementation ofJUnit testing
      and Javadoc.
    Grade: [A]

### 💾 Computer Architecture [CS 3432]

    ~ Compilation, assembly processes, and machine organization.
    ~ Learned how to handle input/output at an assembly level including memory-mapped I/O.
    ~ Created an MSP-430 project that included interrupts and exception handling.
    Grade: [A]

### 🖥 Data Structures [CS 2302]

    ~ Learned about abstract data types and the representation of data using sets, lists, trees, and graphs.
    ~ Optimized code provided during the class in means of runtime and space.
    Grade: [A]
